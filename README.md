# IPASS project
This is an implementation of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). In this repository there is a Graphical User 
Interface (GUI). You can use three different algorithms to calculate the 'optimal' route.
- Nearest Neighbour
- Evolutionary/Genetic
- 2-opt

## Installation
To install this project, first you have to clone the repository. Navigate to the directory where you want the project
to be installed. Then clone the project using this command:
```commandline
git clone "https://github.com/olehertogict/IPASS-project"
```
When the project is done cloning navigate to the project folder in the terminal.
```commandline
cd YOUR_PATH/IPASS-project 
```
And run the following command to install all required packages.
```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Congratulations you are now done with all the installation. To run the project just run the 'main.py' file and the GUI
will appear.

## Usage
The usage of the GUI is fairly straight forward. You can select which algorithm to use for the next calculation using
the dropdown box. You can also choose to use a few different already made TSP problems. To calculate the route click on
'calculate route'. 
There also is the possibility to create an own set of cities to calculate a route for.
